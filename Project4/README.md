# Project 4: Real-World Data Vendor Validation

## Overview
This project simulates the validation of healthcare data from multiple vendors.  
It demonstrates how to compare datasets and detect mismatches before ingestion.

## Key Features
- Generate sample datasets from multiple vendors
- Merge vendor datasets to detect mismatched claims
- Identify differences in claim amounts for same patients/procedures
- Ensure data integrity for downstream analytics

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (pandas, NumPy)
- Vendor Data Validation
- Data Quality Control
- Real-World Data Handling

## How to Run
1. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to simulate vendor datasets and identify mismatches
