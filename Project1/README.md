# Project 1: Healthcare Data Validation Dashboard

## Overview
This project simulates real-world healthcare data validation using EMR, Claims, and Lab datasets.  
It demonstrates data quality checks, anomaly detection, duplicate detection, and data visualization.

## Key Features
- Generate realistic EMR, Claims, and Lab datasets
- Detect duplicate records and missing data
- Identify anomalies in lab test values and claim amounts
- Summarize data quality in a clear report
- Visualize patient age distribution, claims distribution, and lab test distributions

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Data Quality Control and Validation
- Healthcare Real-World Data (RWD)
- Data Visualization

## How to Run
1. Open the `notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to generate datasets and data quality reports
3. View plots and anomaly summaries
