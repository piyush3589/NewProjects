# Project 2: Data Schema Impact Analysis

## Overview
This project simulates schema changes in healthcare datasets to assess their downstream impact.  
It demonstrates how adding, removing, or renaming columns affects data pipelines.

## Key Features
- Simulate schema changes on EMR datasets
- Detect missing, extra, and renamed columns
- Report impact of schema changes on downstream data
- Example of preparing data pipelines for schema updates

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (pandas, NumPy)
- Data Schema Validation
- Real-World Data Awareness
- Problem-Solving and Analysis

## How to Run
1. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to simulate schema changes and view impact reports
